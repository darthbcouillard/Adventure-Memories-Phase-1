# Adventure Memories

### Overview
This is an app that will allow me to track my adventure memories with my partner as we travel the outdoors. It will allow the ability to view the memories all together, as well as to add and remove memories. It will track a title, date, and short description for each memory.

### Project Requirements
* HTML/JS/CSS frontend that runs on a single page that accesses data from a db.json file using json-server
* db.json returns 5+ objects with 3 attributes each
* Interactions between client and API are handled asynchronously
* Uses three distinct types of event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, submit)
* Implements array iteration using both map() and forEach()


### Installation Instructions
* Have json-server installed
* Fork and clone
* Run json server for db.json
* Open index.html in the browser
